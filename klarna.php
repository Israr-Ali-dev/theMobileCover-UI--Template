                            30 days you must be at least 18. Whilst this option is widely promoted, Pay later in 30 days
                            is
                            subject to your financial circumstances. When choosing Pay later in 30 days, our assessment
                            will not

                            style="font-weight: 400;">  Klarna is unique and offers Pay later in 30 days based on a
                            number of
                            factors such as the order value, previous order history and item availability. If you are 18
                            or
                            over, you can improve your chances of being offered Pay later in 30 days by ensuring you
                            provide
                            your full name and accurate address details and shipping to your registered billing address.
                            All
                            orders are assessed individually. Just because you have had Pay later in 30 days before does
                            not
                            mean it will be offered for every order and in turn, as it is denied does not mean it will
                            be denied
                            for all future orders.   </span></p>
